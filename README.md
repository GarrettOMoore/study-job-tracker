# React + Firebase app for software developers trying to break into the industry.

## Decided to build this because I wanted to learn how to implement Firebase auth & realtime databases into a React App, AND I wanted to organize my job search/study time a little better. Voila!

# WIP

## Still planning to add Meetup Event tracking, as well as a study planner.
